This repository contains my submission for the Nomura GM Quant Challenge 2025, which secured a position among the top 6 candidates from IIT Kharagpur. The challenge involved sophisticated quantitative finance problems requiring advanced algorithmic trading strategies and financial instrument pricing.

## üéØ Challenge Overview

The Nomura GM Quant Challenge 2025 consisted of multiple complex quantitative finance problems testing expertise in:
- Algorithmic trading strategy development
- Advanced reinforcement learning for portfolio optimization
- Financial derivatives pricing and risk management
- Transaction cost modeling and optimization
- Real-time strategy selection using AI/ML techniques


## üìã Problem Statements & Solutions

### ** Question 3 : Trading Strategy Implementation**

### ** Task 1: Multi-Strategy Portfolio Construction**

**Problem Statement:**
Develop and implement 5 distinct trading strategies for a universe of 20 financial instruments, then evaluate their performance using cross-validation data without transaction costs.

**Required Strategies:**
1. **Average Weekly Returns Strategy**: Long-short positions based on 250-day rolling weekly return averages
2. **Mean Reversion Strategy**: Positions based on Short Moving Average vs Long Moving Average divergence
3. **Rate of Change (ROC) Strategy**: 7-day momentum-based positioning
4. **Support & Resistance Strategy**: Bollinger Band-like support/resistance level analysis
5. **Stochastic %K Strategy**: Technical indicator-based momentum strategy

**My Approach:**
- **Object-Oriented Architecture**: Implemented `TradingStrategies` class with modular strategy functions
- **Data Preprocessing**: Robust pivot table creation and missing data handling
- **Risk Management**: Each strategy implements proper position sizing (equal-weighted long/short)
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comprehensive backtesting without transaction costs

**Key Implementation Highlights:**
```python
class TradingStrategies:
    def __init__(self, data):
        # Robust data preprocessing and validation
        self.prepare_data()  # Creates optimized pivot tables
    
    def task1_Strategy1(self, current_date_idx):
        # 250-day rolling weekly returns analysis
        # Top 6 stocks get short positions, bottom 6 get long positions
        
    def task1_Strategy5(self, current_date_idx):
        # Stochastic %K implementation with 14-day lookback
        # Advanced technical analysis with proper normalization
```

### **Task 2: Advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning Strategy Selection**

**Problem Statement:**
Develop an intelligent system to dynamically select the best-performing strategy from Task 1 using machine learning, optimizing for risk-adjusted returns.

**My Solution: Advanced Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN)**

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Dueling DDQN**: Separates value and advantage streams for better Q-value estimation
- **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Focuses learning on important experiences
- **Enhanced Market Environment**: 20-dimensional state space capturing market regimes
- **Comprehensive Training**: 150 episodes with 80% of data for robust learning

**Key Innovations:**
```python
class DuelingDQN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size, hidden_size=256):
        # Dueling architecture: Q(s,a) = V(s) + A(s,a) - mean(A(s,a))
        self.value_stream = nn.Sequential(...)
        self.advantage_stream = nn.Sequential(...)

class AdvancedDDQNAgent:
    def __init__(self, ...):
        # Prioritized replay buffer
        self.memory = PrioritizedReplayBuffer(buffer_size)
        # Soft target network updates
        self.update_target_network()
```

**State Space Engineering (20 features):**
1. Short-term (5-day) and long-term (20-day) average returns
2. Volatility indicators (short and long-term)
3. Trend signals (SMA vs LMA ratios)
4. Momentum indicators (5-day and 10-day)
5. Cross-sectional market features
6. Market regime indicators (volatility and trend regimes)
7. Strategy-specific performance history
8. Recent portfolio performance metrics

**Training Methodology:**
- **Daily Training Points**: Every trading day used for maximum data utilization
- **Experience Prioritization**: TD-error based sampling for efficient learning
- **Exploration Strategy**: Epsilon-greedy with adaptive decay
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time strategy performance monitoring

### **Task 3: Transaction Cost-Aware Strategy Selection**

** Problem Statement:**
Implement the DDQN strategy selector on training data while accounting for 1% transaction costs, requiring sophisticated turnover management and cost optimization.

**My Solution: Ultra-Conservative Transaction Cost Management**

**Core Challenge:**
Transaction costs of 1% per unit turnover can quickly erode profits, requiring careful balance between strategy performance and trading frequency.

**Advanced Cost Management Techniques:**

1. **Adaptive Weight Blending:**
```python
# Dynamic blending based on confidence and turnover
base_blend_factor = 0.25  # Conservative base
if confidence < 0.3:
    blend_factor = 0.15   # Higher conservation for low confidence

new_weights = blend_factor * new_weights + (1 - blend_factor) * prev_weights
```

2. **Strategy Stability Tracking:**
```python
strategy_stability_tracker = deque(maxlen=20)
# Penalize frequent strategy switching
if len(set(recent_strategies)) > 1:
    confidence *= 0.3  # Massive confidence reduction
```

3. **Emergency Turnover Controls:**
```python
# Final emergency brake - ensure turnover never exceeds 0.3
if final_turnover > 0.3:
    emergency_blend = 0.3 / (final_turnover + 1e-6)
    new_weights = emergency_blend * new_weights + (1 - emergency_blend) * prev_weights
```

**Cost Optimization Results:**
- Average daily turnover: <0.01% (extremely low)
- Maximum daily turnover: <0.3% (controlled peaks)
- Strategy switch rate: <5% (high stability)
- Zero turnover days: >80% (minimal trading)

## üîß ** Question 2 : ValueNote Pricing Engine (C++ Implementation)**

**Problem Statement:**
Implement high-performance pricing engines for structured financial products with multiple rate conventions and advanced derivatives calculations.

**My C++ Solution:**
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Polymorphic pricing engines with virtual interfaces
- **Multiple Conventions**: Linear, Cumulative, and Recursive rate implementations
- **Advanced Mathematics**: Newton-Raphson root finding for rate calculations
- **Performance Optimization**: Pre-computed factors and move semantics

```cpp
class ValueNote {
private:
    std::unique_ptr<PricingEngine> pricing_engine_;
    
public:
    double calculatePrice(double effective_rate) const noexcept;
    double calculateEffectiveRate(double price) const;
